# pythontcpserver
In this tutorial, I will explain how you can create a simple TCP server, publish it on internet so that you code running on your local machine is available to anyone on the internet. You will not purchase any domain name or any server in the cloud for this.

We will do this in three steps:

1. Create a simple TCP server and client in Python

2. Change the TCP server to handle multiple TCP connections

3. Understand how we can publish the TCP server on the internet.
